# Rigged School Milk prices

Each year, the state of Kentucky invites bids from diaries to supply half-pint containers of fluid milk products for its school districts. In several school districts in northern Kentucky (called the “tricounty” market), two suppliers-Meyer Dairy and Trauth Dairy - were accused of price-fixing - That is, conspiring to allocate the districts so that the winning bidder was predetermined and the price per pint was set above the competitive price. These two dairies were the only two bidders on the milk contracts in the tricounty market between 1983 and 1991. (In contrast, a large number of different dairies won the milk contracts for school districts in the remainder of the northern Kentucky market, called the “surrounding” market.)

The purpose of this project is to determine if there support for the claim that the dairies in the tricounty market participated in collusive practice
